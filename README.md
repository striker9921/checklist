Checklist project.

The goal of this project is to create a task manager that can sort recorded tasks in the order that they should be done in. This program can be used to better manage one's time and help decide the most important thing to do at the moment. This could be especially effective in solving procrastination issues due to "I don't know what to do right now even though there are lots of things to do, so let me go on YouTube".
